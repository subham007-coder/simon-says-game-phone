          <br />
          <mark
            ><span>>></span> Simon gives commands starting with "Simon says" (e.g. "Simon says
            clap your hands").</mark

          <br />
          <mark

            says."</mark

          <br />
          <mark
            ><span>>></span> If a participant follow a command that doesn't start with "Simon
            says" or fails to follow a command that does start with "Simon says"
            they are eliminated from the game.</mark

          <mark
            ><span>>></span> Variations:-Simon can vary the commands to include physical
            actions, like jumping or clapping, or verbal actions, like saying
            specific words.</mark
          >
          <br />
          <mark
            ><span>>></span> Rule Reversal:-In some versions, Simon may try to trick
            participants by saying "Simon says" but giving a command that
            contradicts the action. Participants need to be attentive to avoid
            falling for these tricks.</mark

          <mark
          ><span>>></span> Rotation:After each round, you can rotate the role of Simon,
            allowing different participants to take turns giving commands.</mark
